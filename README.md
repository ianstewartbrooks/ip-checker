# ip-checker

A docker container that contains a small node appliction which monitors any changes in the IP my ISP allocate me.

I wrote this app because I lose my internet connection regularly so this helps me keep a log of the outage. I could of course do this by just looking at the router logs, but that involves lots of scrolling through text and isn't much of a learning process than writing this small dockerised app!
